This tool translates GameShark codes for the PlayStation game Gran Turismo 2 (Gran Turismo/Simulation Mode disc) between NTSC-U 1.0, NTSC-U 1.1, NTSC-U 1.2, PAL, and NTSC-J versions.

The JavaScript code is a refactored and reissued version of the original code which was previously available on this [archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20021201185852/http://www.geocities.com/gt2toxs/gt/translator/gt2codetr.html).
